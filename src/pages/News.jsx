            <h3>Your local milkman supporting the community.</h3>
            <p>We at Woodman’s dairy are proud to support charities and have helped to raise vital funds for Macmillan cancer support. Your local milkman in Cardiff walked Miles for Macmillan and gave our customers a quick and easy way to support local people affected by cancer. We delivered donation envelopes to all of our customers on our rounds across Cardiff and helped to raise £980.
